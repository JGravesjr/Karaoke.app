7-20-16 Commit with README, functions.php, and singerSignUp.php

Contains README detailing the project function, as well as a
functions.php file containing a function allowing us to redirect 
users to different pages, called Redirect. singerSignUp.php 
contains the form used by singers to sign up. At this stage it is a bare bones HTML form.
